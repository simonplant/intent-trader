### Morning Routine Example

```
[PLAN] > analyze dp
AAPL really like this setup above 225, strong conviction
CRM focus trade here, get aggressive on any dip
TSLA worth watching but not excited below 180
SPX 5800 calls if we break yesterday's high - DP calling this

=== DP ANALYSIS ===
📊 Bias: BULLISH
📍 Key Levels: 225, 180, 5800
🎯 Trade Ideas:
  • AAPL: High (0.80)
  • CRM: Exceptional (0.95)
  • TSLA: Low (0.45)
  • SPX: High (0.80)
→ Next: Analyze Mancini for confluence

[PLAN] > analyze mancini
ES 5750 failed breakdown setting up, watch for reclaim
Mode 2 market - complex and choppy
Support at 5740, resistance 5765

=== MANCINI ANALYSIS ===
📊 Market Mode: Mode2
📍 ES Levels: 5750, 5740, 5765
📈 Setups Identified:
  • FB @ ES 5750
→ Next: Create unified plan

[PLAN] > create plan

=== DAILY TRADING PLAN ===
📊 Phase: PLAN → FOCUS

  • CRM: Exceptional (0.95)
High Conviction (0.70-0.89):
  • AAPL: High (0.80)
  • SPX: High (0.80)

📈 MANCINI BLUEPRINT FOCUS:
Failed Breakdowns (Primary Edge):
  • ES: FB @ 5750
    → ES 5750 = SPX 575

✅ EXECUTION RULES:
• DP trades: Size by conviction score
• Mancini trades: Wait for acceptance confirmation
• Never mix scoring methodologies
