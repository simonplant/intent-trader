## Actionable Backlog

| Task                                      | Status    | Priority | P&L Impact | Notes                        |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|------------|------------------------------|
| Add chart analysis IAA                     | Doing     | 1        | Direct     | Highest impact: faster, clearer trade reviews and setups. Immediate P&L benefit. |
| Integrate Manchini's trading style/setups  | Planned   | 2        | Direct     | Will improve futures/ES trade selection. High P&L potential if you trade ES. |
| Integrate DP/Inner Circle's trading style  | Planned   | 3        | Direct     | Will improve stock/ETF trade selection. High P&L potential if you trade equities. |
| SPX Options trading handler                | Backlog   | 6        | Direct     | Only if you plan to trade options this week. Otherwise, lower priority. |
| Automate morning plan/focus workflows      | Planned   | 4        | Indirect   | Saves time, reduces errors, but less direct P&L impact than above. |
| Auto-fetch premarket prices from APIs      | Planned   | 5        | Direct     | Reduces manual work, helps with premarket prep. Some P&L impact. |
| Structured end of day analysis/logging     | Planned   | 7        | Indirect   | Improves review, but P&L impact is longer-term. |
| Trade Plan performance by conviction report| Backlog   | 8        | Indirect   | Useful for review, but not urgent for next week. |
| Auto-journal trades with screenshots       | Backlog   | 9        | Indirect   | Good for learning, but not urgent for next week. |
| End of daily report generation             | Backlog   | 10       | Indirect   | Useful for review, but not urgent for next week. |
| End of day Coaching IAA/handler code       | Backlog   | 11       | Indirect   | Behavioral improvement is valuable, but not immediate P&L. |
| Persistent KB incorporated                 | Backlog   | 12       | Indirect   | Longer-term benefit, not urgent. |
| Usage analytics & improvement flywheel     | Parked    | -        | Unclear    | Not urgent. |

# BACKLOG OF NEW IDEAS - TO BE INTEGRATED

- As a stock trader i want to review the conviction, confidence, sentiment, and energy settings, to move into parameters so i can easily manage them separately from code.
- As a stock trader i want to move capital amount and sizing rules into parameters, so i can easily manage them separately from code.
- As a user i want to add classifications to trade ideas once the market opens at 3:00a (earlier for Mancini's futures ideas; Labels are waiting, triggered, invalidated, closed, other), so that i can more easily focus and execute profitable trade ideas.
- As a user i want to parameterize the chart analysis system (e.g. chart colors, sma's, pivot point indicators, etc.) so i can easily manage them separately from code.
- As a stock trade i want to add functionality to clean DPs morning call transcript (tickers, names, analyst names, company names to tickers, typos, inconsistent formatting, blatantly incorrect pricing levels), so i can easily manage them separately from code.
- As a stock trader i want to update the app to implement market direction analysis to implement wyckoff market modes, so i may better understand the price action.
- As a stock trader i want to import x.com posts from @AdamMancini4 on ES_F, so i can get intraday updates on trade plans and trade idea execution status.

- Process for how to get regular price updates into the app (e.g. hourly reminder)

-  today‚Äôs premarket news flow and ‚Äúmost active‚Äù/‚Äúbiggest movers‚Äù lists found via financial news sites (Investing.com, Barrons, Yahoo, etc.) using a web lookup
