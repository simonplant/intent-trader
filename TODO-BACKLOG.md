# Intent Trader - TODO & Backlog

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2024-05-28  
**Status:** MVP Complete âœ…

## Mission
Ship a production-ready, solo trader-focused, no-bloat trading assistant implementing all PFEMRC workflow, dual scoring, journaling, context save/load, and robust assistant features.

---

## MUST-HAVE MVP LAUNCH (Finish ALL Before Release)

- [x] PFEMRC phases: Plan, Focus, Execute, Manage, Review, Coach â€” all as explicit handlers
- [x] Data models: Modern `dataclasses` for TradePlan, TradeIntent, ConvictionScore; all state must be type-safe and auditable
- [x] Dual scoring: Attach analyst & system conviction (0.0â€“1.0) to every trade/intent
- [x] Intent/phase registry: Handlers are cleanly mapped and extensible
- [x] NLP intent detection: Fast keyword/phrase mapping to workflow phases and commands
- [x] All assistant utilities: Save, Load, Journal, Help, Context, Reset â€” always available
- [x] In-memory journaling: Timestamped entries for every trade and note, viewable on demand
- [x] Context flatten/restore: Can save and load the full trading session (JSON) in a single command
- [x] Position & PnL tracking: Positions and basic running PnL stored in plan state
- [x] Behavioral pattern checks: Alerts for revenge/tilt/stop-out, toggleable or extensible
- [x] Clean markdown output: All responses and summaries formatted for easy reading and pasting
- [x] Full error handling: Type/value checks, user-facing errors only, never corrupt or crash state
- [x] Quick context/session reset: Fresh start at any time, zero confusion or legacy data
- [x] Minimal unit/integration tests: Each handler and full workflow path tested once
- [x] Usage docs: One example session in README, command list, save/load/journal demo

## "DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT" GUIDELINES

- No broker APIs, no DB, no cloud, no analytics/dashboard â€” only hooks for later âœ…
- No legacy or CLI code, no in-line user manual bloat â€” README and help command only âœ…
- No multi-user logic, no permissions, no extra abstraction layers âœ…
- Everything extensible, nothing over-architected âœ…
