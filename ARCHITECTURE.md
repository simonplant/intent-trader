## Data Flow

1. **Market Data Flow**
   - Market data is received through the MarketDataFeed
   - Data is processed and normalized by DataProcessor
   - Processed data is stored in DataStorage
   - Data is made available to strategies through StrategyManager

2. **Order Flow**
   - Strategies generate trading signals
   - Signals are validated by SignalProcessor
   - Valid signals are converted to orders by OrderManager
   - Orders are executed through OrderExecutor
   - Order status is tracked and updated in OrderBook

3. **Performance Tracking Flow**
   - Trade execution data is captured by PerformanceTracker
   - Performance metrics are calculated by MetricsCalculator
   - Risk metrics are analyzed by RiskAnalyzer
   - Reports are generated by ReportGenerator
   - Visualizations are created by ChartGenerator

## System Interfaces

### 1. Exchange Interface
- REST API for order execution
- WebSocket for real-time market data
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Authentication and security

### 2. Database Interface
- Time-series data storage
- Order history
- Performance metrics
- Configuration storage
