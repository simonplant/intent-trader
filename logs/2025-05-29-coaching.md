# Trading Session After Action Review – May 29, 2025

## 1. Context & Market Conditions

### Macro/News
- Court blocks Trump tariffs; instant market rally, then risk-off as headlines evolve and Trump signals intent to fight
- NVDA earnings strong, but data center miss and China headwinds. Tariff "TACO" meme and volatility in news cycle

### Opening State
- Most of the Inner Circle (IC) traders flat or hesitant—only 4 out of ~300 shorted QQQ at the open (very low conviction in community)
- Anticipated headline risk and "whipsaw" conditions kept traders cautious

---

## 2. Personal Performance & Execution

### Plan
- Entered with a robust, unified trade plan (mod positions, Mancini roadmap, real-time macro/news)

### Execution
- Did not take any trades
- Experienced multiple moments of disorientation—lost track of prevailing tape regime amid headlines and volatility
- Chose caution over chasing moves, concerned about headline reversals and not wanting to get squeezed

### Mental State
- Recognized risk of "paralysis by analysis" and struggled to reorient during regime changes
- Maintained discipline—did not FOMO or force entries
- Used chart decoder and rechecked alignment repeatedly, but hesitation remained

---

## 3. Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- Capital and composure preserved
- Caution respected, did not chase low-probability or late moves
- Repeated check-ins on market bias, plan vs. tape, and news

### What Could Be Improved
- **Reorientation Protocol**: Need a clearer process to regain market context after being thrown off by headlines or regime changes
- **Starter/Feeler Positions**: Develop the habit of putting on minimal size to stay engaged and reduce fear of missing
- **Scripted Execution**: Codify rules for when to take mechanical entries, even in high-volatility/headline risk periods
- **Emotional Audit**: Log key emotional responses and their impacts for future pattern recognition
- **Playbook for Headline-Driven Tape**: Explicit rules for either sitting out or reducing size when headline risk is dominant

## 4. Action Steps for Next Session

| Area | Next Step/Process Update |
|------|-------------------------|
| Reorientation | Formalize a 3-step "reorient" routine (zoom out, restate plan, define regime & triggers) |
| Execution | Allow micro-entries with defined stops when bias aligns, even in uncertainty |
| Review | Use a quick emotional audit at session mid-point and close |
| Playbook | Develop "headline tape" playbook with reduced risk rules or explicit "sit out" zones |
| Accountability | Document "should-have" trades and decision rationales for iterative learning, not self-criticism |

## 5. Key Quotes/Observations
> "There was way too much headline risk as obviously Trump would fight back against the courts blocking tariffs."

> "I was flat and didn't want to chase. I felt like I lost the direction several times and needed to reorient."

> "Only 4 out of 300 Inner Circle traders took the QQQ short at the open—was not easy/obvious."

## 6. Coach's Comment

You respected risk and avoided the emotional traps of FOMO or overconfidence. The next level is building a reorientation and micro-execution routine to ensure you're not totally sidelined when genuine edge appears, even on confusing days. "Participation without conviction" (small, process-driven entries) is your bridge to high performance.
